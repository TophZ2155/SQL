# Project List Details
### Project 1: Superstore Database[^1]
This project demonstrates basic SQL functionality by querying data from a distributor / retail database. Detailed tasks included in the code but encompass: 
1. ordering items by specific details,
2. descriptive statistics of specific items,
3. stock amount, etc.
> Includes queries:  `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`.

> SQL Dialect: `Standard`

### Project 2: Fortune 500 Analysis[^1]
This project demonstrates advanced SQL functionality by querying data from a descriptive database of Fortune 500 companies. Detailed tasks included in the code but encompass:
1. determining industry leaders,
2. placing companies within a work-life balance category,
3. determining true- and relative-company size, and individual industry ratio as a whole of the the total revenue across industries.
> Includes queries: `SUM`, `MAX`, `ROUND`, `OVER`, `CASE`, `AND`, `OR`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`

> SQL Dialect: `Standard`

### Project 3: Employee Reporting, Wages, and Hiring[^1]
This project demonstrates relational querying with SQL "join" functions using a self-made database that includes employee information, department information, and company organization information. Detailed tasks are included in the code but encompass:
1. using a single join to display complete employee information by last name,
2. using multiple joins to display direct-superior-reporting using two unique tables in which one is self-joined,
3. displays a department's remaining hiring budget, indicates whether an additional hire is allowed, and how many additional employees can be hired based on a base salary estimate.
> Includes queries: `JOIN~ON`, `AS`, `CASE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`

> SQL Dialect: `Standard`

### Project 4: PostgreSQL and Movies
This project demonstrates the various basic and advanced SQL functionality in the PostgreSQL dialect using a database of Netflix movies and TV shows. Detailed tasks are included in the code but encompass:
1.  counting and ordering movies based on specific details,
2.  narrowing query results for specific information,
3.  subquerying.
> Includes queries: `COUNT`, `MAX(DATE()`, `JOIN~ON`, `AND`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`

> SQL Dialect: `PostgreSQL`
